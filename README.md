# nicole-brewer.github.io (Archive)

## History
My user site used for only project pages. index.html contains an "easter egg" and a redirect to [my personal website](https://nicole-brewer.com).

## Notes
I used to have the nicole-brewer.com domain set up to point to my main site, and all my project pages (via this repository) pointing to project.nicole-brewer.com/<repo>. This repository was the landing page for project.nicole-brewer.com which showed a picture of me holding an easter egg and automatically redirected to nicole-brewer.com. DSN's have confused me for quite some time and I'm pretty sure this whole setup was not the best.
